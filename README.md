## SIMORGH

Simorgh is a free extension for browsers to protect persian users from phishing attacks and forged banking portal.

#### TODO list:

1. Create a nice GUI for ./client/extui/block.html (We can only use Cross-browser JS and HTML code and maybe JQuery)
2. Add a 'Continue anyway' (in persian) button to ./client/extui/block.html.
3. Update the chrome extension and test it with both chrome for desktop and chrome for android.
4. Clean up the ./client/exclusion.list file (our preference is a white list of only government websites, famous shopping websites, search engines and web-archive and maybe some other famous persian websites).
